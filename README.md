👉 Triggering a merge conflict



This exercise is designed to increase your comfort working with git in a team based environment.
You’ll be triggering a merge conflict and working through resolving it.

Step 1 - Repository Creation
In your pair, choose one person, we’ll call them “Developer A”, to create a on their own personal GitHub account.
When creating the repository choose to initialise it with a README file. That file can be utilised to trigger the merge conflict. Call the repository whatever you like!


Step 2 - Clone the repository down to your local machine
“Developer A” can now clone the repository down to their local machine


Step 3 - Invite a collaborator
“Developer A” can now invite the person they are pairing with, we’ll call them “Developer B”, to act as a “collaborator” on that repository. Follow these instructions to invite them as a collaborator:
https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository
“Developer B” should receive an email asking them to accept the invite


Step 4 - Clone the repository down to your local machine
“Developer B” can now also clone the repository down to their local machine


Step 5 - Trigger a merge conflict
Using what you’ve been taught in the earlier session now attempt to trigger a merge conflict.


Step 6 - Screenshot the conflict for your submission
When you successfully trigger the merge conflict, take a screenshot of it. You can utilise this to submit your task 🙌Step 7 - Resolve the merge conflict
Work together to resolve the merge conflict. ✅
Take a screenshot of your git commit history shown on the GitHub website where it includes the resolved merge conflict.
Bask in the glory of finding a new found love of git! 😍


💥 How do I make a submission? 💥

Attach two images
A screenshot showing your merge conflict (either the terminal highlighting that there is a merge conflict or your IDE showing it in conflict resolution mode)
A screenshot showing your git commit history and the merge conflict resolved.
Both people in the pair can attach the exact same screenshots
